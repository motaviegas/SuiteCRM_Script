# SuiteCRM_Script

![alt text](/logo_x2.png)

Installation of SuiteCRM on a Ubuntu server 24.04 of the following versions:

- 7.14
- 8.7.1 
- 8.9

Easily with a Script File

There isn't much user-friendly documentation available for easily installing this great CRM, so I created a tested SuiteCRM installation script that will allow you to install it on a Linux computer or a virtual Linux machine in under 10 minutes.

      NOTE: I am not affiliated with the SuiteCRM team, nor am I being supported by them.
