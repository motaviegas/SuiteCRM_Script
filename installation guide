Steps to follow:

    Install a lunix server / or use an existing one. This scrit was tested in a Ubuntu server 24.04

    Open the terminal and create a sh file, you can give whatever name you want just be sure to have the extension “yourfilename”.sh. I use nano

  sudo nano "yourfilename".sh

Copy the entire lines inside the sh s_crm_0.1.sh file

Change the permissions of the new sh file useing this command

    sudo chmod +x "yourfilename".sh

To run the new script use the following command

    sudo ./"yourfilename".sh

Follow the script requests and take note of the user & password of the databse that will be requested

When the script finishes run the command

    sudo mysql_secure_installation

just press enter (there is no root password

Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] Y

Change the root password? [Y/n] y

put your DB root password and take note of it!!!

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y

    Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]

    Now you can use the IP address and conclude the instalation of the CSuite CRM using the DB user and passwords you choose at the begining.

    On the webpag config on these fields you place
    DATABASE CONFIGURATION:
    SuiteCRM Database User
    USER THAT YOU CHOOSE ON THE SCRIPT
    SuiteCRM Database User Password
    PASSWORD THAT YOU CHOOSE ON THE SCRIPT
    Host Name
    localhost
    Database Name
    CRM

Then the rest you decide which admin user and admin password
GOOD LUCK!
